# Code for parameter estimation with covid data
Stan files for both the pre and post lockdown models are available in .stan files

UK data has been used in both files with uk in the title to estimate the spreading rate, recovery, and death rate as well as r0 of covid19 pre and post lockdown
intervention. This is done via bayesian inference


Italy data has been used in both files with italy in the title to estimate the spreading rate, recovery, and death rate as well as r0 of covid19 pre and post lockdown
intervention. This is done via bayesian inference


MLE refers to maximum likelihood estimation and this uses uk data to estimate the parameters mentioned above using MLE to compare with bayesian inference.
